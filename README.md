The monthly average gas productions for the next 6 months of 44 shale gas wells were predicted. The Korea National Oil Corporation was interested in purchasing shale gas wells from the United States of America, and needed to predict their productions in order to select the wells that maximize profit.

A combination of ***LightGBM*** and ***Exponential smoothing*** was used to predict the productions and Integer programming using ***Gurobi*** was used for optimization to maximize profit. Evaluation was based on ***sMAPE (symmetric mean absolute percentage error).*** Our team was ranked among the best with a percentage error of *25.54%.* The best team had a percentage error of *19.49%.*
